    RetroAchievements support for nds-bootstrap -- shared definitions.

    Layering (kept deliberately strict, see docs/retroachievements.md):

      ra_reader   -- the per-frame bridge in the cardengine, plus the snapshot that is this
                     project's only debug channel. The watchlist it used to hold, and later
                     the overlay, both moved to cardenginei_arm9_ra where there is room.
      ra_overlay  -- draws a notification over the game. Knows nothing about RA: it is handed
                     a count and some pixels. Lives in cardenginei_arm9_ra.
      ra_text     -- the font and the renderer, also in cardenginei_arm9_ra. 760 bytes of
                     printable ASCII that never had anywhere else to go.
      ra_rcheevos -- the rcheevos runtime, the staged set, and the unlock ring that crosses
                     to the ARM7. cardenginei_arm9_ra.
      ra_net      -- HTTP transport to the RA servers, in the launcher.
      ra_patch    -- the streaming scanner that turns r=patch into the staged block.
      ra_wifi     -- the fifteen-rung ladder the launcher climbs, and the log it writes.

    `rc_client` is deliberately absent and stays absent -- see open question #4. The session
    layer is the launcher's ladder instead.

    Master switch for the whole RA reader. Set to 0 to build a cardengine that
    behaves exactly like upstream nds-bootstrap: no extra per-frame work and no
    interrupt hook of its own.

    Note what it no longer switches off, because that changed: the reader used to force
    IRQ_VCOUNT on for games that never asked for one, sharing the colour LUT's hook. It
    chains onto the game's own VBlank handler now -- an interrupt the game already enables
    for itself -- so a reader build no longer turns anything on that was off.

    Eight cardengine variants compile this file, and the reader is not wanted in all
    of them. Two groups opt out by default:

      DLDI -- nds-bootstrap running from a flashcard in DS mode. Out of scope for the
      fork, which targets the DSi-capable path, and out of room besides: after phase 1
      `arm9_twlsdk_dldi` and `arm9_twlsdk3_dldi` have 176 bytes left in their windows
      and `arm9_dldi` has 208, against the reader's ~550.

      GSDD -- cardRead() is where the per-frame hook installs itself, and these variants
      do not take that path. The reader could never tick there; carrying it was only ever
      dead weight.

    Override on the command line (-DRA_READER_ENABLED=1) to build it anyway.

    Step 3b: handing an earned achievement id from the game to the SD card.

    The cardengine has no network and the ARM9 has no SD card -- on a DSi the card is the ARM7's, and
    every file nds-bootstrap writes from inside a game goes through fileWrite() there. So an unlock
    detected by rcheevos on the ARM9 has to cross to the ARM7, which appends it to the queue file the
    launcher pre-created, and the *next* boot's launcher sends it. See RA_QUEUE_PATH in ra_wifi.h.

    The channel is the one that already exists rather than a new one. `sharedAddr` is how the ARM9
    cardengine has always driven the ARM7 -- card reads, the reset and exit commands, the in-game
    menu's battery and clock -- and the ARM7 already polls it from its VBlank handler. Two things come
    with that for free, and both would have been work: the region is coherent between the two CPUs
    with nothing but `volatile` (every card read in every game depends on that being true), and there
    is an established idiom of a magic in one slot and data in the next.

    Slots 0-8 are taken and slot 13 is UNPATCHED_FUNCTION_LOCATION, so these are two of the only four
    that exist. See CARDENGINE_SHARED_SLOTS -- the bound is asserted where these are used.

    The protocol, deliberately as small as it can be:

      ARM9  writes the id into ID, then the magic into REQ.  (that order: the ARM7 can wake between
                                                              the two writes, and a magic with a stale
                                                              id would award the wrong achievement)
      ARM7  sees REQ == magic, appends the id, writes 0 to REQ.
      ARM9  will not write another request while REQ is non-zero.

    One in flight at a time, which is not a limitation worth removing: the ARM7 clears it within a
    frame and a set does not fire two achievements in the same frame often enough to matter. The ARM9
    side keeps the rest in its own queue and offers one per frame.

    And the same request from a hardcore session. **The mode rides in the magic rather than in a slot
    of its own**, and that is a deliberate trade rather than a squeeze.

    Slots 11 and 12 are free and either would hold a flag. There are only four slots in total, two of
    them already spent here, and spending a third on one bit would leave this feature holding half of
    everything the ARM9 will ever be able to say to the ARM7. The magic is already a word the ARM7
    compares against a constant, so a second constant costs one more compare and no address space.

    It also makes the wrong thing impossible rather than merely unlikely. With a separate flag slot,
    a request written without setting it reads as softcore *by omission* -- a missed store in a path
    added later, a stale value from the previous unlock. Here the mode and the request are the same
    word: there is no way to raise the request without saying which kind it is.

/*
    And **how much of the request the ARM7 should actually carry out**, in a slot of its own.

    This is an instrument, not a feature, and it exists because the last round of reasoning was wrong
    and cost a hardware boot to find out. `queue=0` proved the freeze lives somewhere in the handoff;
    a gate on `readOngoing` closed the one window that argument pointed at, and Ketsui froze again on
    the same boss. Worse, the queue record it wrote came back **complete and correct** -- id, stamp,
    game code, title, hardcore flag -- which says the append ran to the end. So the freeze is not a
    hang inside the write, and every remaining suspect is a *side effect* of work the ARM7 does on the
    frame an achievement fires:

      the RTC read     rtcTransaction() bit-bangs RTC_CR8 with swiDelay(48) per edge, twice: about
                       128 + 32 delays, order 4-5 ms sitting inside the VBlank handler with the I bit
                       set, which is 4-5 ms the FIFO handler is not servicing the ARM9's card reads
      the SD work      6 sector reads and a read-modify-write, on the controller and NDMA channel the
                       game streams through
      the handoff      two words into the shared block and a request the ARM7 answers

    Three candidates, no way to tell them apart by reading, and each guess costs a flash and a boss
    fight. So the level says which of them to do, it rides in a slot the ARM9 writes before the magic
    exactly as it writes the id, and the ladder is walked from the quiet end:

      0  the ARM9 does not offer at all          gated in ra_rc_offer_unlock(), never reaches here
      3  handoff only                            the request is acknowledged and cleared, nothing else
      2  no RTC stamp                            **retired** -- see below; behaves as 1
      1  everything                              the shipping behaviour

    Whichever step the freeze comes back at is the step that causes it, and each one is an `ra.cfg`
    edit rather than a rebuild. Level 2 is also the only one that is a usable fallback rather than
    purely diagnostic: a bare id still submits, it just loses `o=`, so the server dates the unlock by
    the boot that reported it.

    **A slot rather than more magics**, which is the opposite of the call made for hardcore one field
    up -- and for a reason that inverts cleanly. The mode had to be inseparable from the request
    because a missing mode reads as softcore *by omission* and silently mis-files a real unlock. A
    missing level reads as garbage, and garbage is not a mode this can be wrong about quietly: the
    ARM7 tests for 3 and for 2 and does everything otherwise, so anything unrecognised lands on the
    shipping behaviour. The failure direction is toward doing the work, not toward skipping it.

    of the game's way entirely: raStampCapture() now reads it once, at init. There is nothing left for

    And **when** either side may act on that request, which is the whole of the Ketsui freeze.

    The append runs on the ARM7, from its VBlank handler, with IME off. The comment there argued that
    IME off was enough because "a competing read cannot *start* underneath this write". That is true
    and insufficient: a card read does not have to start underneath the write to be ruined by it, it
    can already be *half done*.

    The ROM read path on that CPU is resumable. start_cardRead_arm9() calls fileReadNonBLocking(),
    which issues an sdmmc command, returns false, and leaves `readOngoing` set with the outstanding
    command id in the reader's context; the transfer finishes in the SD controller, and a later poke of
    the FIFO handler calls resumeFileRead(), which asks CARD_CheckCommand() whether that command is
    done. Between those two moments the game's read exists only as hardware state -- one command
    outstanding on the one SD controller, plus 512 bytes of my_fat.c's single `globalBuffer`.

    A VBlank landing in that window ran the append straight through it: new commands on the same
    controller, the same buffer rewritten. Which is exactly the pair of symptoms reported, in both
    directions at once -- the game's read never completed and the ARM9 spun on it forever (the freeze
    at Ketsui's boss kill, twice, with the on-screen popup already switched off), and the record that
    came out held the game's bytes (ra_unlocks.txt containing Ketsui's credits text). Setting queue=0,
    which skips the append and nothing else, removed the freeze. That is the diagnosis: not the
    overlay, not the unlock, the write.

    So the work waits, and it waits on **two sides for two different reasons**:

      ARM7   `readOngoing`, at the top of raUnlockService(). Correctness, and it can only live there:
             the flag is that CPU's own state and nothing else can see it. The request word is left
             standing, so the next frame retries.

      ARM9   raCardReadPending(), below, in ra_rc_offer_unlock(). Courtesy, not correctness -- a
             request the ARM7 has not served yet cannot corrupt anything, it just means the ARM9 is
             sitting in its card-read stub waiting, and the FIFO handler that would serve it cannot run
             while the append holds IME off. So the unlock is not offered at all until the read has
             been answered; it stays in the ring and goes out on a later frame.

    The split is not symmetry for its own sake, it is where the bytes are. Testing one more word on the
    ARM7 cost more than that binary has: cardenginei_arm7 for TWL-SDK games links into 33K with 60
    bytes spare, and adding the check there put .bss four bytes past the end of the region. The ARM9
    side has room, already holds `shared` in a register, and is the side that decides when to offer.
    Measured, not guessed -- see the size note in raUnlockService().

    The predicate lives in a header both sides can see because it is the one part of this that can be
    checked without a card: a pure test over one word, whose truth table tools/ra_reader_test.c pins.

	        bit 7     a notification is owed *right now* and has not been raised

	    Bit 5 is there because a real unlock fires when a stage ends, which is precisely when a game fades

	    that reports drawn, is never denied or evicted, and is still not seen -- while the demo timer's
	    identical call is seen, because it fires on an ordinary frame.

	    **And bit 5 was wrong when that explanation was called confirmed.** It tested only the blend factor

	    It consults the mode now; the register is live at 0x0400106C for anyone who wants the value itself.

	    Bit 7 is the one that was missing, and its absence cost a hardware run. Every other bit here is
	    written by draw(), which only runs when a notification *is* raised -- so the state that most needed
	    reporting was the one state nothing could report. Contra 4 came back with rcTriggered 1 and

	    Registers and choice belong together and that is why the choice is what is stored: the registers
	    themselves are hardware, readable live from the RAM viewer at 0x04001000 and 0x04001008, and the
	    one thing a photograph cannot recover is which block surveyBlocks() concluded was free. Contra 4

	    The overlay writes white and black into bank 15's ink and shadow entries and puts them back

	    Bit 7 is the one worth naming. At 8bpp there are no sixteen-colour banks: the map's palette
	    field is ignored and a pixel value indexes all 256 entries directly. So `OVERLAY_PAL_BANK * 16

	    **The beacon: an unlock, published for a reader on the 3DS's other CPU.**
	    ============================================================================================

	    This is one half of a bridge whose other half does not exist yet, and it is built anyway
	    because the half that is missing belongs to somebody else.

	    A 3DS running a DS game boots TWL_FIRM, whose ARM11 side runs `TwlBg` -- the module that takes
	    the DS picture and puts it on the 3DS's screens. Anything drawn *there* is drawn after the DS
	    hardware is finished: no borrowed background layer, no sprite slot, no palette entry, no VRAM.
	    It is the one place a notification can appear that cannot corrupt the running game, and it
	    would work on every game rather than on the ones where a survey happens to find a free corner.

	    The channel between the two CPUs already exists and is proven: **RTCom**, two free legacy RTC
	    registers that both the ARM7 and the ARM11 can read and write, refreshed every frame. It is
	    what gives DS games circle-pad input on a 3DS today. What has never been done by anyone is the
	    drawing: every published TwlBg patch changes scaling, filtering or input, and the circle-pad
	    project says in as many words that it does not touch the framebuffer.

	    So this side publishes, and says exactly where and in what shape, so that asking the TWPatcher
	    and RTCom authors "can you draw this?" is a concrete question with an address rather than an
	    idea. See docs/twlbg-overlay-proposal.md.

	    **The protocol is one counter and no handshake.**

	      notifySeq    starts at 0 and is incremented once per unlock, forever. A reader keeps the
	                   last value it saw and shows a notification when it changes. Nothing is ever
	                   cleared and nothing is acknowledged, so a reader that starts late, restarts, or
	                   misses a frame simply resynchronises on the next unlock instead of hanging on a
	                   flag nobody will clear. Zero means nothing has fired this session.

	      the payload  is written **before** the counter, always. A reader that sees a new sequence has
	                   a complete record behind it. That ordering is the entire synchronisation.

	    **Written through the cache, deliberately.** These bytes are useless to another processor while
	    they sit in this one's data cache, so the range is cleaned and the write buffer drained before
	    the sequence goes out -- see ra_beacon_publish(). Everything else in this snapshot is read by
	    the in-game menu, which is the same CPU and needs no such thing; the beacon is the first field
	    here written for somebody else.

	    **Nothing new is allocated for it.** It rides in the snapshot rather than at a fixed address of
	    its own, because taking a new address in the game's main RAM is precisely the class of risk
	    this project spent a week removing. The cost is that a reader has to find the snapshot, whose
	    address moves between builds -- so it scans for the `RA2S` magic once at startup. If the other
	    side would rather have a fixed address, that is a decision to make with them rather than for
	    them.

    A note on what that pair settled, because it is the answer to four hardware runs and it lives here
    rather than in the overlay: **the notification is only ever visible on BG0.**

    The DS orders backgrounds by BGCNT bits 0-1, lower value in front, and **breaks ties by layer number**.
    The overlay takes priority 0, the strongest there is, so it beats any enabled layer at priority 1 or
    worse and loses to any *lower-numbered* enabled layer at priority 0 -- with nothing below 0 to reach
    for.

    Measured: during stage 1 gameplay on Contra 4 the pulse probe read `overlayState` 0x08 -- layer **0** --
    and was plainly visible, with `overlayDispcnt` 0x00211E10 showing the game's BG0 *off* and BG1, BG2, BG3
    and OBJ on. Both real unlocks read 0x4A -- layer **1** -- and were not seen at all.

    The same reading closed the other two doors it was taken to test: bits 13-15 clear, so no window is
    active and `overlayWindow` is 0 for a reason rather than by accident; bits 16-17 = 1, so the display
    mode is graphics; bit 7 clear, so no forced blank.

    The priorities themselves are not published, and do not need to be: chooseLayer() only refuses at layer
    N when layer N is enabled *and* at priority 0, so a denial together with that layer's enable bit in
    overlayDispcnt says the priority was 0 by construction.
