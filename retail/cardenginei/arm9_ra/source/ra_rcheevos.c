/*
    rcheevos, running inside a DS game.

    This is the file where the project stops being a memory reader and starts being a
    RetroAchievements client: rcheevos is the same library the official emulator
    integrations use, and its runtime is what turns a definition string from the server
    into "this achievement just unlocked". Everything before it -- the WRAM window, the
    hand-written crt0, the heap -- existed to make this file possible.

    Three things about the DS shape the code here.

    The first is that achievement definitions come from the network. An address in a
    definition is a number someone else wrote, and on this platform dereferencing an
    address the console does not have is a Data Abort inside the game's interrupt handler.
    So peek() routes every read through the same ra_readable() the watchlist uses, and
    ra_rc_validate_address() is handed to rcheevos up front so an achievement that asks
    for memory this console cannot supply is disabled rather than evaluated against zeros.

    The second is that RetroAchievements addresses are console addresses, not DS
    addresses: the server's map puts DS system RAM at 0 and the emulator's frontend is
    expected to translate. We translate with our own three-line map rather than calling
    rcheevos' rc_console_memory_regions(), because that function's switch references the
    table for every console it supports -- forty-odd tables of regions and names -- and
    calling it would drag all of them into a 64K image to answer a question about one
    console.

    The third is that the ARM9 does not fault on an unaligned 32-bit load, it silently
    returns rotated data. Achievement authors write unaligned reads routinely and the
    server will happily serve them, so peek() assembles those from bytes. Refusing them
    would break real definitions and trusting the hardware would return plausible
    nonsense, which is worse.

    the same terms as the rest of the project.

    scanlines for 45 definitions, against 71 scanlines of blanking, and the note that recorded it
    said what made that affordable: the work fits inside the blanking period and touches no visible
    line. A larger set does not fit. Chrono Trigger spills past line 262 into drawn pixels, which is
    tearing on a good frame and a dead ARM9 on a frame where the game had no slack -- entering Leene
    Square, every time.

    RA_RC_FRAME_SKIP_MAX bounds the throttle rather than the cost, so a pathological reading cannot
    stall detection for seconds. Three means the set is evaluated at worst every fourth frame, about

    A stack of our own for rcheevos, which is the fix for two Data Aborts.

    Everything in this binary runs inside the game's VCOUNT interrupt handler -- see
    myIrqHandlerVcount() in cardenginei_arm9 -- so it runs on the game's IRQ stack, whose size is
    the game's business and not something we get to know. Measured on a host with
    -finstrument-functions:

        rc_runtime_do_frame()                 767 bytes
        rc_runtime_activate_achievement()   2,383 bytes

    The first has run every frame for many sessions without trouble, so the IRQ stack
    accommodates it. The second wants 3.1 times as much, and it is what the first real
    achievement set introduced: fifty-six parses instead of three. Both hardware crashes had a
    wild PC inside the *game's* memory with a null data address, which is what trampling the
    memory below an IRQ stack looks like from the outside.

    Why the three-definition builds worked is worth being honest about: they overflowed too. They
    did it three times, during boot, over memory the game had not started using. That is luck,
    and this document has a section about the last time luck was mistaken for a result.

    8 KB against a measured 2,383, and it costs nothing that matters -- the arena has 130 KB of
    margin with the set this large. The high-water mark is reported, so the next reading replaces
    the host's number with the console's.

    all: on a host RA_VCOUNT is a mapped register that never advances, so every frame measures free.

    `room` is zero on hardware only if the evaluation began outside the blanking period, meaning the

    Whether to start an evaluation at all this frame, given what the last one cost, how much blanking
    is left right now, and how long it has been since one was allowed to run.

    This is the half ra_rc_frame_skip() cannot do, and hardware said so. Skipping frames lowers the
    *average* cost and leaves the *peak* exactly where it was: the frame that does run still spills
    past line 262 by however much it always did. That is enough to cure a game the accumulated cost
    was killing -- Leene Square stopped freezing -- and it cannot cure an artefact caused by one
    overrunning frame. A tear or a wobble every fourth frame is what a bounded reactive throttle
    looks like on screen, which is what Chrono Trigger's world map kept showing.

    So the decision moves in front of the work: run when the room measured *this* frame can hold what
    the last one cost, and otherwise do not start. The predictor is the last cost rather than the
    worst-ever cost on purpose -- linesMax is raised for good by a single expensive frame, such as the
    one where a trigger fires and events are delivered, and predicting from a high-water mark would
    starve every ordinary frame after it.

    Two escapes, both required:

      - **A cost of zero always runs.** Nothing has been measured yet, or the work is free; either
        way there is nothing to schedule around. This is also what keeps the host suite honest, since
        on a host RA_VCOUNT never advances and every frame measures both free and roomless.
      - **Starvation always runs.** A game whose own VBlank handler leaves nothing behind would
        otherwise stop the reader for the session, and a reader that never evaluates is a worse bug

    larger piece, and the cost is not proportional to the piece -- rc_update_memref_values() runs on
    every call whatever the slice, so a fixed share of every measurement belongs to work that dividing
    cannot reduce. Guessing that share wrong in the optimistic direction produces exactly the
    oscillation this is here to end. Rising only is monotone, converges in at most seven frames, and
    what a spurious step costs is sample rate rather than correctness.

    So on every game RetroAchievements does not know -- which is when the self-test runs -- this
    fired, went down the ring to the ARM7, was written to sd:/ra_unlocks.txt, and was submitted.
    Achievement 1 is a real, published achievement on a Mega Drive game, so the server accepted it
    and filed it on the player's account. It had been doing that since the self-test existed.

    The guard in ra_rc_queue_unlock() below was written for exactly this failure and did not catch

    card was found carrying `4026531840` -- 0xF0000000 -- which is what a *staged definition with no
    id* gets. The built-in self-test is the other kind of idless definition and had a constant of its
    own, four hundred lines away, that the fix never touched. One bug, two spellings, and the fix
    spelled it one way.

    Making the two the same value is what closes it rather than another check: there is no longer a
    number here that the guard has to be told about separately. Nothing collides -- an idless staged
    definition takes `RA_SYNTHETIC_ID_BASE + i`, and the self-test only activates when no definition

    It is anchored at console address 0, and that is the interesting part.

    The obvious anchor would have been the snapshot's own tick counter, and that is what

    Console address 0 is the first word of the game's own RAM. Always mapped, always

    What this covers: a memref read, a comparison, a hit target, the measured flag, the

    The viewer's index, filled while the block is still pristine.

    Called once per record by ra_split_definitions(), from inside the loop and **before** that loop
    replaces this record's tabs with NULs. That ordering is the whole reason this function exists
    rather than living in the menu: see CARDENGINEI_ARM9_RA_VIEWER_LOCATION.

    `base` is the definitions text, so the offsets recorded here are what the menu can use against
    its own view of the same bytes -- the block is at one address here and another in the launcher
    that staged it, and only an offset means the same thing in both.

    Fields are found by counting tabs from the start of the record, which works for both shapes
    without knowing which it is: neither a memaddr nor an id can contain one. So tab 1 opens the
    title, tab 2 the points and tab 3 the description, whether the record began with `<id>:<memaddr>`
    or with `#!<id>`.

    **And each tab is replaced by a NUL as it is recorded**, which is what makes every offset here
    the start of a C string. The first version left that to the caller and got it half right: the
    armed path cut the first two tabs and nothing cut the third, so `pointsOff` pointed at
    `5\tClear Stage 2` -- and an earned record, which the split skips entirely, had all three tabs
    intact and gave a title of `Welcome to the Jungle\t3\tClear Stage 1`. The host suite caught both
    by reading the fields back through the index rather than by inspecting the buffer.

    Cutting here also removes a duplication: the memaddr and the title are terminated by the same
    two cuts, so ra_split_definitions() now takes both from the entry instead of walking the record
    a second time with its own copy of the rule.

    Returns the entry, or NULL when the index is full, so the caller can use the offsets it just
    recorded.

    Bring rcheevos up and report how far it got. Two functions rather than one, and the split is

    definitions and installs any watch lines. ra_rc_activate_next() then activates **one**
    definition per frame until the set is in.

    Why: fifty-six definitions cannot be parsed inside a single interrupt. Each costs the same
    ~2.4 KB of stack -- measured on a host, and flat, so depth is not what scales -- plus its own
    slice of time, and the first run that tried all fifty-six in one VCOUNT handler ended in a
    Data Abort with the ARM9 executing the definition text as code. That total time is still
    unmeasured, which is exactly why it is the leading suspect and why the fix is to stop doing
    it rather than to reason about it further.

    The second reason is diagnostic and matters just as much. rcActivated is published *before*
    each activation is attempted, so a crash names the line it died on. A set that dies at the
    same definition every time is one definition's problem; a set that gets through all of them

    never run once, so nothing could ever unlock. `ticks` and `wramTicks` both stopped at 15, so the

    Why the reader stops at fifteen frames is a separate and still-open question. This does not depend
    on the answer: finishing in a handful of frames instead of forty-five means the set is armed inside
    whatever window exists, which is worth having either way -- an achievement that arms half a second
    into a session rather than three quarters is strictly better even when nothing is broken.

    The budget is measured rather than guessed. rcInitLines reported 27 scanlines for the most
    expensive single definition of this set against a frame of 263, so RA_RC_INIT_BUDGET_LINES sits
    under half a frame and at least one definition is always attempted -- the check is after the work,
