# Build the ROM that gets handed to a person, and refuse to produce one that is not what it claims.
#
# This exists because of a specific failure, and the failure is worth writing down because nothing in
# the build would have caught it. The pre-delivery checklist in docs/retroachievements.md says a ROM
# must compile at RA_LAUNCHER_WIFI=0 and =2. Running both `make`s satisfies that -- and leaves
# retail/bin/nds-bootstrap.nds holding whichever one ran *last*. Copying it after a `=0` build hands
# over a launcher with no network: no RetroAchievements ladder, nothing staged for the cardengine, and
# cardenginei_arm9_ra falling back to its built-in self-test, which fires one unlock with the synthetic
# id 0xF0000000 seconds into the game.
#
# That was mistaken for an intermittent memory fault for several days. The arena, the pending block's
# address and the launcher's statics were all blamed in turn, on evidence that was really "did the =2
# build happen to run last this time". The logs agreed with each other and not with the console,
# because a boot with no network never rewrites ra_wifi_launcher.log -- so the log being read was the
# previous, working boot's.
#
# So: the order is fixed here rather than remembered, and the result is verified against the binary
# rather than against intent. `=0` is built first because it is only a compile check; `=2` is built
# last because it is the deliverable.

# From scratch, always, and that is a finding rather than caution.
#
# The ROM handed over for a hardware test was for a long time whatever an *incremental* build left on
# disk, and this project's development involves running `make` inside individual cardengine
# directories all day to measure link margins. Building the same commit clean, at the same path,
# produced a **different binary** -- so at least one artifact in that tree was not being rebuilt when
# it should have been, and the ROM under test did not reproduce from its own source.
#
# That is the one thing this script exists to prevent: it already refuses to ship a build that is not
# what it claims. A binary nobody can reproduce is exactly that, and it is worse than a wrong flag
# because a hardware result gets attached to it. Every reading in docs/devlogs is a reading of some
# specific binary; if that binary cannot be rebuilt, the reading cannot be checked.
#
# The cost is a few minutes per release. The alternative is test results that mean nothing.
#
# **This does not make the build reproducible for anyone else**, and that is a separate, known
# limitation: dsiwifi's lwip compiles __FILE__ into 26 assertion strings, so the absolute source path
# is embedded in the ROM. Two clean builds of the same commit at different paths differ -- and because
# the payloads are LZ77-compressed, a handful of changed bytes cascades into most of the file. Same
# path, same result; different path, different bytes. Fixing that means -ffile-prefix-map through
# upstream's build, which is not this script's to change.
