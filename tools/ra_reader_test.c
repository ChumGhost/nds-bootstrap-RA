/*
    Host-side test for the RA watchlist and its pointer-chain walker.

    Everything else in this fork has to be checked by flashing a card and reading hex out
    of the in-game menu's RAM viewer, which is slow enough that three separate bugs in the
    overlay each cost a flash cycle to find. The walker is pure logic over addresses, so it
    does not need the hardware -- and getting it wrong is a Data Abort inside the game's
    interrupt handler, i.e. a crash rather than a glitch. So it is tested here first.

    It compiles cardenginei_arm9_ra's source verbatim -- statics and all, nothing stubbed
    or conditionally compiled. The trick that makes that a real test rather than a mock is
    the link address: the runner links this at 0x02100000 and maps a page at 0x04000000, so
    the snapshot it hands over really does sit inside the main RAM range the walker
    validates against, and the I/O reads really do land on mapped memory. The chain
    self-tests resolve for the same reason they do on hardware, not because a check was
    relaxed.

    It followed the code when the watchlist moved out of the cardengine and into DSi WRAM;
    that is the point of pointing it at a source file rather than at an interface.

    Run it with tools/ra_reader_test.sh.

    __bss_start, __bss_end and __vram_top are NOT defined here. The runner supplies them with
    --defsym, as absolute addresses inside the real DSi WRAM window this test mmaps below, and
    that is a fix rather than a flourish.

    They used to be 1-byte dummies in this file, and the cardengine takes their *addresses*:
    `ra_startup(__bss_start, __bss_end, ...)` zeroes the range between the first two and puts
    its arena at the second. Which meant the arena was whatever the linker's ordering of three
    dummy symbols happened to make it -- and the linker is under no obligation to keep them in
    declaration order. It bit twice. Adding rcheevos' hash.c to the link put __vram_top *below*
    __bss_end, making the span -1 and the arena the whole process; and raising
    RA_DEFS_MAX_LINES from 8 to 128 added 512 bytes of statics to this translation unit and did
    it again. Both times the suite passed at -O0 and segfaulted at -O1, in tests unrelated to
    the change.

    With --defsym the addresses are chosen rather than inherited, and they mirror hardware: the
    window at CARDENGINEI_ARM9_RA_LOCATION, a 16K .bss at the bottom, the definitions block at
    the top, and the arena between them. Nothing added to this file can move it again.

    The scratch window below is the same lesson at smaller scale. The tests that call
    ra_startup() directly hand it a .bss range and an arena top, and the arena has to be real
    memory *contiguous with* the .bss -- which two separate arrays, `fakeBss` and `fakeArena`,
    were only ever by the linker's good manners. One buffer with offsets into it is correct by
    construction.

    Step two's log classifier.

    Different subject from everything above -- the launcher rather than the cardengine --
    and here rather than in a second runner for a plain reason: this file is the thing
    docs/retroachievements.md tells you to run before anything else, and a check nobody
    runs is not a check.

    It earns its place the same way the example-file test does. raWifiVerdict reads how the
    Atheros chip arrived out of dsiwifi's printf text, because the driver exposes none of
    those facts any other way, and its failure mode is silent: a renamed string does not
    break a build, it reports the wrong world after a play session. So the strings are
    pinned here against the log a real console produced, and the runner greps the submodule
    for the format strings besides.

    Unlike the cardengine sources above, the launcher's two files are *linked* rather than
    #included -- see the runner. That is not a style preference. `__bss_end` and `__vram_top`
    are 1-byte dummies in this translation unit whose *addresses* define the arena
    `ra_alloc.c` hands out, so any static added to this TU moves what lies between them and
    the allocator starts writing over live variables. Including ra_hash.c here did exactly
    that: the suite passed at -O0 and segfaulted at -O1, several tests before the new code
    was even reached. Anything with file-scope state stays in its own TU.
